# implementing-apis-using-laravel
You are asked to implement the following APIs using Laravel - Deadline tomorrow 11:59 PM: Create an API that receives a string consisting of lowercase letters, uppercase letters and numbers and returns the string sorted (in a JSON object) in the same way as the examples below. "eA2a1E" ➞ "aAeE12" "Re4r" ➞ "erR4" "6jnM31Q" ➞ "jMnQ136" "846ZIbo" ➞ "bIoZ468" Create an API that recives a number $num and returns each place value in the number. 39 ➞ [30, 9] -434 ➞ [-400, -30, -4] 100 ➞ [100, 0, 0] Create an API that translates from Human to Programer by replacing the numbers in a string with their binary form. "I have 2 sheep." ➞ "I have 10 sheep." "My father was born in 1974.10.25." ➞ "My father was born in 11110110110.1010.11001." "10hell76o4 boi" ➞ "1010hell1001100o100 boi" N.B: --> There are possibly two or more numbers in a single word (I do not recommend splitting the text at spaces, it surely won't help). --> Anything separates two numbers, even spaces ("2 2" --> "10 10"). Create an API that takes care of Prefix Notation Evaluation.The API receives a mathematical expression in prefix notation as a string and evaluates the expression. "+ 5 4" ➞ 9 "* 12 2" ➞ 24 "+ -10 10" ➞ 0

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
